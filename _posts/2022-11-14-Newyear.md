title: Happy New Year from our lab!

New year, new resolutions, but never forget old traditions. Cake to celebrate each other’s birthday is truly important. Today we belatedly celebrate Kai’s birthday with homemade Belgian cake.

This is also a great moment to celebrate the great bunch we have together in the lab. Of course, this begs for a new year’s lab gift: the Circadian Cardiometabolism 2023 beanie!

These ones look good on all of our members and will keep us warm during the winter months. We had a great moment together and are very much looking forward to a fruitful, safe and healthy year and wish the same to all our fellow scientists!
