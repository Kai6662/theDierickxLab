title: Welcome to Margaux, our new French Postdoc
---


Margaux obtained her PhD at the Université Côte d'Azur in Nice in Cellular and Molecular Interactions. In this lab, she studied how the biophysical properties of the microenvironment increase resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies in melanoma, under the supervision of Dr. Sophie Tartare-Deckert.  
In the Dierickx lab, she will use her expertise in microscopy and cell interactions to understand how the circadian clock plays a role in different cardiac cell types contributing to heart function. Outside of the lab, she enjoys reading books, hiking and traveling to discover different places.
