title: Summer lab BBQ

---

On Friday we had our half time lab BBQ. The brief rain showers could not stop us from having fun. All people brought authentic food to make our BBQ a real success. Very grateful to be working with such an inspiring and talented group of scientists. Looking forward to the second half of the year!
