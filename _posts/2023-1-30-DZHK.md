We are extremely grateful to receive support from the German Heart Foundation: DZHK. In the next 6 years we will study how the cardiac circadian clock drives rhythmic process in the heart. In addition, based on knowledge of the circadian clock, we are aiming to devise new strategies to treat and prevent cardiovascular diseases. Thank you very much, DZHK. Please find the links below:
