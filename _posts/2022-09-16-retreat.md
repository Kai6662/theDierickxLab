title: Kai and Bryce had a fantastic first IMPRS retreat.

---

The annual retreat is a highlight of the IMPRS year. It is an opportunity to discuss science off the bench or desk and get to know each other better. We go as a student group, with our coordinator. Sometimes, we invite post-docs along to share their expertise and experience with us.
