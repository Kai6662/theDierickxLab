Seval Kübra Korkunç | PhD student
Seval earned her B.Sc. degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Üsküdar University. She completed her Master’s degree at Koç University School of Medicine in Immunology.  During her M.Sc, she studied the T-regulatory cell and  Notch axis in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) inflammation under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hasan Bayram. In the Dierickx lab, she will focus on disease progression in human metabolic heart failure. She loves photography (unfortunately, her friends’ personal photographer) and is interested in art history.

Daniëlle Ammerlaan | Master’s student

Daniëlle obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at Utrecht University and is currently finalizing her Master’s degree in Biology of Disease with a specific focus on cardiovascular research. Her interest in cardiometabolism developed early on when studying the role of ketone bodies as a potential heart failure treatment in rat cardiomyocytes. Outside of the lab, she enjoys drinking tea, practice sports, visiting bars with friends, and one day she aims to run half a marathon. Additionally, in Bad Nauheim she hopes to retrieve an advanced command of the German language.
