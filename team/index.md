In 2017 he joined the lab of Prof. Dr. Mitchell Lazar at UPenn (US) as a Postdoctoral researcher to study the role of the circadian nuclear receptors REV-ERBα/β in the heart. Dr. Pieterjan Dierickx joined the Max Planck for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim as an independent research group leader in May, 2022 where his lab is focused on the role of circadian rhythms in cardiometabolism.</p>

He received his dual BS degree in Biology and Biomedical Engineering from Emory and Georgia Tech. As an undergraduate he conducted research in cancer genetics and animal biomechanics, and subsequently worked as a flow cytometry specialist at Raybiotech.  Chao returns to GT-Emory with an interest in exploring computational methods in biomedical research.  His research leverages electrophysiology, computational modeling, and control system engineering tools to study neuroplasticity in visual circuits.</p>
