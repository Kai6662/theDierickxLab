Dr. Dierickx obtained his Master’s degree from Ghent University (Belgium) and completed his PhD in the groups of Prof. Dr. Niels Geijsen and Linda van Laake at the Hubrecht Institute (The Netherlands), where he developed stem-cell based models to study development of the circadian clock during directed cardiomyocyte differentiation. In 2017 he joined the lab of Prof. Dr. Mitchell Lazar at UPenn (US) as a Postdoctoral researcher to study the role of the circadian nuclear receptors REV-ERBα/β in the heart. Dr. Pieterjan Dierickx joined the Max Planck for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim as an independent research group leader in May, 2022 where his lab is focused on the role of circadian rhythms in cardiometabolism.

Bryce studied at the University of Pennsylvania for a B.A. in Cellular and Molecular Biology. While there, he worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Mitchell Lazar in the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, starting off his interest in circadian rhythms and metabolism research. Unrelatedly but simultaneously, he discovered a love for Lindy Hop, food from around the world, and social story games.

Kai studied the genomics and evolution of endangered animals for her master's degree in bioinformatics at Sichuan University. She started enjoying cardiovascular research when she was working on GWAS and single cell analyses at UMCU in the Netherlands.  She is curious about everything around her. She loves to travel and adventure. After obtaining her Scuba Diving license she is now learning to solo skydive and in the future she would like to learn to fly light aircraft.

Ankita comes from a small lovely town Darbhanga in India. She obtained her bachelor’s in Biotechnology in Jaipur (India) and her master’s degree from the Technical University Dresden (Germany) in the field of Molecular Bioengineering. During her studies, she worked on neurons, brain organoids, and cardiomyocytes. She started enjoying cardiac cells more and could not stop thinking about how to use stem cells as a model to gain some insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac arrest. Besides science, she loves dancing, cooking, and still dreams of becoming a star in a movie where she would play a smart scientist.

Yannick just finished his apprenticeship at the university clinic in Homburg and will start working his first full time job as a TA in the Dierickx group.
He is also studying at the university of applied sciences Kaiserslautern and wants to obtain his B.Sc. After that he is looking into options of continuing his part time studies to get a Master's degree.
When he's not in the lab Yannick is the singer for a local band in his hometown, collects vinyls of his favourite bands or does lots of different sports like handball or volleyball.
