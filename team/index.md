Dr. Dierickx obtained his Master’s degree from Ghent University (Belgium) and completed his PhD in the groups of Prof. Dr. Niels Geijsen and Linda van Laake at the Hubrecht Institute (The Netherlands), where he developed stem-cell based models to study development of the circadian clock during directed cardiomyocyte differentiation. In 2017 he joined the lab of Prof. Dr. Mitchell Lazar at UPenn (US) as a Postdoctoral researcher to study the role of the circadian nuclear receptors REV-ERBα/β in the heart. Dr. Pieterjan Dierickx joined the Max Planck for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim as an independent research group leader in May, 2022 where his lab is focused on the role of circadian rhythms in cardiometabolism.

Bryce studied at the University of Pennsylvania for a B.A. in Cellular and Molecular Biology. While there, he worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Mitchell Lazar in the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, starting off his interest in circadian rhythms and metabolism research. Unrelatedly but simultaneously, he discovered a love for Lindy Hop, food from around the world, and social story games.

Ankita is from a small lovely town Darbhanga ( India). She obtained B. Tech ( Biotechnology) in Jaipur (India) and a master’s degree from Technical University Dresden ( Germany) in the field of Molecular Bioengineering. During her studies, she worked on neurons, brain organoids, and cardiomyocytes. She started enjoying cardiac cells more and could not stop thinking about how using stem cells as a model we could find some insights to unravel the molecular mechanisms in cardiac arrest. Besides Science, she loves dancing and cooking and still dreams to become a star in a movie where she would play a smart Scientist
